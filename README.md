# todoapp-api

This is my backend project. I have created this api  which u can integrate in your project and make a complete working todo app easily.
Users can signup, login, logout, delete ,update your account ,upload profile picture, crete task, delete task n update it . I have also hashed password n used authentication.
Whenenver user will join your app or delete their account respective mails will be send. For this I have use SendGrid service.
Use this api and make your project easy to complete.
